# `code.now`
A powerful web code editor

## Features
- Lightweight
- Supports multiple languages: From C and C++ to Python and JavaScript, code.now supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete for a wide range of languages
- Share code easily: With [Github Gists](), you can easily share code for people to see just with the github gist ID.

## Why another code editor?
This code editor isn't designed to be a complete IDE for running projects on the web, but rather a lightweight and simple code editor that people can use to write and share code snippets online easily and free. 

> We do have some more features coming on to help with sharing code snippets and communicating between others
